# fizz-buzz-test - Take two

Coding challenge demonstrating a solution to the Fizz Buzz problem, using C#, that is built using Reflection and which demonstrates a clean, Test Driven approach using SOLID design principles.

The code seeks to solve the following:

Given a range of numbers, loop through each number and output the following:
•	If the number is divisible by 3 then output the word Fizz instead of the number.
•	If the number is divisible by 5 then output the word Buzz instead of the number.
•	If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5 then output the word Fizzbuzz instead of the number.
•	If none of the above conditions are met then output the number.
